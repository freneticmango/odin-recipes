        <h4>You probably shouldn't drink it, but I'm tempted every time.</h4>

        <p>This enchilada sauce is the most correct topping for
            enchiladas. Yes, there are sauces available in the grocery 
            store, but they are sauce knock-offs and will surely have a 
            negative impact on your enchilada enjoyment.
        </p>

        <p>Making this sauce gets easier every time, but you could also
            make a big batch and save it for your next enchilada night for 
            the path of least resistance to delicious enchiladas.

            <li><strong>1 tablespoons</strong> chili powder (or more 
                if you love eating fire)
            </li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> cumin</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 teaspoon</strong> garlic powder</li>
            <li><strong>1/4 teaspoon</strong> dried oregano</li>
            <li><strong>1/4 teaspoon</strong> salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Pinch of cinnamon</li>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> tomato paste</li>
            <li><strong>2 cups</strong> vegetable broth</li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> apple cider or distilled 
                white vinegar
            </li>
            <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to bring it all together:</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Measure dry ingredients into a small bowl and place
                it near the stove. Place tomato paste and broth nearby 
                as well.
            </li>
            <li>Warm oil in a medium pot over medium heat till a 
                sprinkle of the flour mixture sizzles on contact.
            </li>
            <li>Once hot, pour in flour mixture. Whisk constantly. 
                Cook till fragrant and starting to turn golden, about 
                a minute. Whisk in tomato paste, then slowly pour in
                broth while constantly whisking to prevent lumps.
            </li>
            <li>Raise heat to medium high and bring sauce to a simmer.
                Cook, whisking often, for about 5 to 7 minutes. Sauce 
                should be thickened and a spoon should feel resistance
                while stirring.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from heat, whisk in vinegar, and season with
                black peppper to taste. Add salt if needed.
            </li>
