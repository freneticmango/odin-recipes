        <h4> Comfort on a cold winter evening. </h4>

        <p>We love a warm bowl of beany stew and pasta on a cold night.
        And on a warm night. And any other night really, this is 
        an easy and delicious go-to when you don't know what to
        have for dinner. So most of the time.
        </p>
        
        <p>In addition to being delicious, it's also a great way to 
        trick yourself into eating a lot of greens since the greens 
        are covered in bacon fat, butter, and parmesan. We are 
        unsure if this negates the health benefits of the greens, 
        but it's probably ok.

        <h2>~Let's Get Cooking~</h2>

        <h3>You will need:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5 ounces</strong> (1 1/2 cups) orechiette</li>
            <li><strong>4 cups</strong> chicken or veggie stock</li>

                size pieces
            </li>
            <li><strong>3</strong> garlic cloves</li>
            <li><strong>1 pound</strong> collard greens (2 small 
                bunches)
            </li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> (15.5-oz.) can cannellini beanies, 
                drained and rinsed
            </li>
            <li><strong>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon</strong> red pepper flakes, 
                add more if you like lava like me
            </li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li><strong>1 ounce</strong> Parmesan or pecorino, or just 
                measure with your heart, finely grated 
            </li>
            <li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> butter (if using salted, 
                adjust added salt accordingly)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to bring it all together:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Place pasta in a small bowl and cover with 1 1/2 cups 
                chicken stock or water, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Add bacon to a dutch oven or large pot along with a 
                small amount of water. Cook over medium heat, stirring 
                occasionally, till fat has melted out of the bacon and 
                it is crispy and browned.
            </li>
            <li>Peel and finely chop or grate garlic. Remove stems from 
                collard greens. Cut collards into bite sized pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Remove bacon from the dutch oven with a slotted spoon. 
                Add garlic and cook for about 1 minute, then add red 
                pepper flake and cook for an additional 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>Add the collards, the remaining chicken stock or water, 
                and a generous pinch of salt and black pepper. Turn heat
                up to high to bring to a boil, then reduce heat to 
                maintain a low simmer. Add the beans. Cook till liquid 
                is reduced and collards are tender, about 45 minutes. 
                Taste, and add salt and pepper if necessary. (We want 
                slightly over-seasoned so that seasoning is correct 
                after pasta is added.)
            </li>
            <li>Add pasta along with the soaking broth or water. Simmer, 
                stirring constantly, till pasta is al dente or as firm 
                as you prefer. Remove from heat and add cheese, butter, 
                and bacon. Stir well. Taste and add salt, black pepper, 
                or red pepper flakes if needed.
            </li>
            <li>Serve with added cheese on top and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
