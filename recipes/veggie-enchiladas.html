        <h4>Veggies, beans, and cheese wrapped in a tortilla blanket and 
            topped with more cheese.</h4>

        <p>These enchiladas are the perfect vehicle for a big helping of 
        vegetables, since they are smothered in cheese and a delicious 
        Mexican sauce. The crispy tortilla ends give them a satisfying
        crunch, and the beans add protein too help you get those
        gains.</p>
        
        <p>You can make these enchiladas with store bought sauce, but 
        you would be wrong to do so. The recipe for the homemade (and
        correct) enchilada sauce is <a>here.</a>

        <h2>~Let's Get Cooking~</h2>

        <h3>You will need:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 cups</strong> <a>homemade enchilada sauce</a></li>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> olive oil</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> red onion, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> red bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> bunch of broccoli or cauliflower, sliced into bite sized pieces</li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> ground cumin</li>
            <li><strong>1/4 teaspoon</strong> ground cinnamon</li>
            <li><strong>5 to 6 ounces</strong> baby spinach</li>
            <li><strong>1 can</strong> (15 ounces) black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 teaspoon</strong> salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li><strong>8</strong> flour tortillas</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> handful chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to bring it all together:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit with one rack
            in the middle and the other in the upper third. Lightly
            grease a 9 by 13 inch pan with cooking spray or olive oil.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 
            onions and a pinch of salt. Cook until onions are tender
            and translucent. Add broccoli and bell pepper, stir, and 
            reduct heat to medium low. Cover skillet and cook until
            broccoli is bright green and just started to turn golden.</li>
            <li>Add cumin and cinnamon and cook until fragrant. Add 
            spinach a handful at a time and cook down until all spinach 
            has cooked down.</li>
            <li>Transfer cooked veggies to a medium mixing bowl. Add 
            beans, 1/4 cup of cheese and a drizzle of enchilada sauce.
            Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup enchilada sauce into the greased pan and 
            spread evenly over the bottom. Spread 1/2 cup veggie bean 
            filling down the center of a tortilla and wrap it snugly. 
            Place the wrap seam down in the greased pan. Repeat with 
            remaining tortillas and filling.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the remaining enchilada sauce evenly over the 
            enchiladas, leaving their tips bare for crisping. Sprinkle 
            the remaining shredded cheese evenly over the enchiladas.</li>
            <li>Bake, uncovered, on the middle rack for 20 minutes. 
            transfer to the upper rack and bake an additional 3 to 6 
            minutes to turn cheese golden.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and <em>let the enchiladas rest</em>
            for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro and serve.</li>
        </ol>
